# Shop - A Case Study of the Flow of Data
This project takes a look at how data travels from a button press on an android device to a REST-ful micro-service, and then back to the user. It is a simple way for students, or new engineers who sometimes know how each piece of the puzzle functions, but has had trouble placing them together.

Overall, this is an **Android application** where users can buy goods, and the **REST-ful microservice's** intended to scale, and handle ACID manipulation/storage of the produced data.

_Please note this is still a WIP, and will constantly be iterated on to implement more functionality on both the 'client', and 'services' spectrum._
